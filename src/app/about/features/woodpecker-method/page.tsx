          The Woodpecker Method, developed by Grandmasters Axel Smith and Hans
          Tikkanen, is a game-changing approach to improving at chess tactics.
          It focuses on solving a large set of puzzles and then re-solving them
          faster and more accurately, embedding core tactical patterns into your
          subconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method is tailored to your chess rating, providing a personalized
          training experience that automates tracking and admin, allowing you to
          focus solely on puzzle-solving.

          Our Tactics Trainer lets you build and solve a customized set of
          150-500 puzzles, suited to your chess rating. We track your time and
          accuracy, helping you improve both as you progress through the
          puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sessions are designed to be intense yet rewarding, with each
          puzzle set aiming to challenge and improve your tactical abilities
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to getting the most out of the Woodpecker Method is to ensure
          the puzzles are challenging enough to push you, but not so difficult
          that you can't solve them. Ideally each puzzle on your first run
          through should take between 1-2 minutes to solve. If you find yourself
          taking longer than this, you may want to consider reducing the
          difficulty of the puzzle set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time you complete a tactics set, you will naturally get faster as
          the patterns become embedded in your subconscious. The recommended
          amount is 8 repetitions, with a break of 3-4 days after you finish a
          set. This allows your brain to process the patterns and commit them to
          memory.
