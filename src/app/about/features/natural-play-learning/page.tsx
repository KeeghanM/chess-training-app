        <p>
          Natural Play Learning is a groundbreaking technique developed
          exclusively by ChessTraining.app. This method revolutionizes
          traditional chess training by combining the effectiveness of Spaced
          Repetition with a creative twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          By ensuring you only "learn" a move once, and after that are shown it
          directly in context as you would when playing, we not only cut down on
          the time it takes to learn a move, but also ensure you retain it for
          longer.
        </p>
        <Heading as="h3">Here's how it works:</Heading>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Learning Through Playing:</strong> Instead of monotonously
            re-learning the same moves, you engage with them in a more natural,
            game-like environment. Once you master a move, it becomes a core
            part of your game play.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficient and Engaging:</strong> As you play through your
            openings, if you encounter a familiar position, you skip the basic
            steps and directly engage with the new challenges. This approach not
            only makes learning more efficient but also deeply engaging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tailored to All Levels:</strong> Whether you're a beginner
            or a seasoned Grandmaster, our Natural Play Learning method is
            designed to cater to every skill level.
