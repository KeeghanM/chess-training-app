        <p>
          ChessTraining.app started as a personal project by Keeghan, fueled by
          his own needs and desires in his chess journey. Recognizing a gap in
          the online world for comprehensive and user-friendly chess training
          tools, he set out to create a platform that he would love to use
          daily. Since then (and with the help of our community),
          ChessTraining.app has grown into a leading chess training platform,
          with thousands of users worldwide. We're proud of our humble
          beginnings and are excited to continue our own journey of chess
          mastery alongside you.
