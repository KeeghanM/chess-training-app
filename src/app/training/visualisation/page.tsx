          Do you struggle to see past two or three moves? Find long calculations
          difficult? Our Visualisation Trainer is designed for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our trainer, you're presented with a board position and a
          sequence of moves. Your task is to visualize these moves in your mind,
          and find the correct final move.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tool was designed with both beginners and advanced players in
          mind, with completely customisable settings. You can choose the number
          of moves to visualize and the difficulty of the puzzles, to really set
          the level of challenge you want.

          You'll be presented with a position and a list of moves. Visualize the
          given moves in your head, and try to find the correct move in that
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you think you've found the correct move, enter it on the board.
          If you're correct, great! Move on to the next one. If not, you can
          keep trying or skip to the next puzzle. You can also use the "Show
          Solution" button to reveal the correct answer.
