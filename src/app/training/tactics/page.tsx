          In our Chess Tactics Trainer we have implemented the{' '}

            Woodpecker Method
          </StyledLink>
          . This allows you to automaticcaly build a set of between 20-500 chess
          puzzles. Each one tailored to your chess rating, and based on the
          chess tactics and themes that you want to focus on.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will automatically track your time and accuracy across the chess
          puzzles. This means all the admin work required in the WoodPecker
          method is taken care of for you - you just focus on solving chess
          puzzles. Remember, these puzzles should be difficult for you to solve!
          For best results, break your practice into 30-60 minute sessions once
          a day. Your first time through a puzzle set should take 1-2 weeks.

        <p>
          The Woodpecker Method is based on solving a large set of puzzles; then
          solving the same puzzles again and again, only faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          The puzzles should be difficult but not impossible, in the 2-5 minute
          range to solve. Not 30 seconds. By repeating the set over and over,
          you will get faster and more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          However this isn't simple memorisation! Rather, you internalise and
          bake into your subconscious the core ideas and patterns.
