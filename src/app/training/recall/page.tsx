          Chess is all about recognizing patterns and positions. The ability to
          recall critical details about a position can be a game-changer. Our
          Recall Trainer helps you build this essential skill, ensuring that you
          can visualize chess positions with ease.

          You can customize the difficulty level by adjusting the viewing time,
          the number of pieces on the board, and the number of pieces you need
          to recall. It's flexible training designed to meet your specific
          needs.

          smaller, more easily recognizable positions, improving your memory and
          chess vision.
